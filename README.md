Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cesar Augusto Lombardi. Currently I'm a full stack web developer.

Currently I'm working with React and Node, but I also worked with Java, Angular, AngularJS, MySql, Oracle, Postgres, and others.

ðŸŽ“ I graduated in Business with focus on international trade, but few years later I decided to move my career to a different area.
I thought I was too old for tech and used to say to myself: "It's not possible to learn programming!". 
After recognizing that if I didn't lear I would be left behind I changed the phrase to: "It's not possible NOT to learn programming!"
Guess what! I did learn, and I LOVED it!

I am passionate about people, finances and Tech.
So, if you love finances and/or tech and are a human being, let's connect! 
Maybe we can collaborate, maybe we can build something great!
